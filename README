AdminFramework
==============

Yet another Rails plugin to provide some consistency in building "admin areas".
Read on for requirements, installation instructions, and how to remove.


Requirements
============

The following plugins are required so go get them and install them:

http://agilewebdevelopment.com/plugins/link_out_to
http://agilewebdevelopment.com/plugins/clear_helper
http://agilewebdevelopment.com/plugins/form_helper_css
http://agilewebdevelopment.com/plugins/will_paginate

Installation Steps
==================

If your installation didn't already run the install.rb, do that now:

  ruby vendor/plugins/admin_framework/install.rb

Then run the migration:

  rake db:migrate VERSION=197405240832_create_admin_users

Then install the following routes:

  map.with_options :controller => 'admin/dashboard' do |r|
    r.admin '/admin'
    r.admin_login '/admin/login', :action => 'login'
    r.admin_logout '/admin/logout', :action => 'logout'
  end

  map.namespace(:admin) do |admin|
    admin.resources :admin_users
    # add your other admin routes here
  end
  

Uninstall Steps
===============

Remove the admin_users table by downing the migration:

  rake db:migrate:down VERSION=197405240832_create_admin_users

Remove all the files:

  ruby vendor/plugins/admin_framework/uninstall.rb

There may still be some cleanup if you've made local modifications.

Rake Tasks
==========

There is one rake task that you can run to copy into place new images,
javascripts, and stylesheets.

  rake admin_framework:update
